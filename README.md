# Titanic-Data-Analysis-SQL
The Titanic project involves analyzing the historical Titanic dataset to uncover insights using MySQL queries. The dataset contains information about passengers, including demographics, travel details, and survival outcomes. The primary objectives of this project include:

Data Exploration:
> Understanding the structure of the dataset, such as passenger names, gender, age, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
> Examining relationships between different columns to identify trends and patterns.

Query-Based Analysis:
> Filtering passengers based on criteria like gender, age group, or travel class.
> Calculating survival rates for different demographics, such as men, women, children, and different ticket classes.
> Identifying trends, such as whether passengers in higher ticket classes had better survival chances.

Aggregate Functions:
> Using functions like COUNT(), AVG(), and SUM() to calculate statistics, such as the average age of passengers, survival counts, and total fare collected.

Complex Queries:
> Writing nested and subqueries to filter and analyze data more precisely.

The project showcases how structured query language (SQL) can be applied to real-world datasets for data analysis, helping to extract meaningful insights from historical events.
